Parismi uses code from a number of projects listed in the Credits section of the top-level README file, which come under various licenses (GPL, BSD, Apache, etc.) or are in the public domain. The GPL is the lowest common denominator. We are dual-licensing Parismi-specific code and modifications to pre-existing code on a file-by-file basis, under either the GPL or the BSD two-clause license. In other words, anyone can freely modify Parismiâ€™s code and redistribute it under the GPL. Anyone who removes GPL-licensed code from Parismi should be able to distribute the modified project under a BSD-like license.
