<title>Parismi can be run in interactive mode, as an ImageJ plugin, or in batch mode</title>

</head>
<body>
<p>Parismi can be run in interactive mode, as an ImageJ plugin, or in batch mode.</p>

<p><strong>Interactive mode</strong></p>

<p>Open <code>Parismi/IJ/ij.jar</code> and select <code>A0PipelineManager</code> from the plugin menu. To load a
pre-existing pipeline (which can be a good way of exploring Parismi's functionality),
either click the "Load table" button and select an <code>.xml</code> file from our dataset release,
or drag such a file and drop it onto the Parismi control panel.</p>

<p><em>Overall pipeline structure</em></p>

<p>Each step in the pipeline corresponds to one row in the GUI table. Table columns include
the following:
  - <em>Primary image input</em>. A right click in the field provides a popup menu to assist with
  input selection. The input can be a file on disk (specified with a full path name, in
  which <code>~/</code> or <code>~username/</code> can be used as shorthand for user home directories, or a
  path name relative to the current working directory), an image opened through ImageJ
  and specified by its name, or the output of another plugin. In the latter case, the
  reference to the other plugin is given as number specifying the row offset (i.e. -1 to
  specify the output of the preceding plugin), or as a number prefixed by <code>$</code> to specify
  an absolute row in the table. Parismi can natively read TIFFs with 32-bit or 64-bit
  offsets and LSM files. It can transparently decompress GNU zipped files that it
  recognizes with the <code>.gz</code> extension. Large image files can be opened as "virtual
  stacks", which means their contents are initially not fully loaded into memory (this is
  done by default for files over 2 GB in size; this behavior can be manually adjusted with
  the "Use virtual stacks to open files" checkbox). Note that some (but not all) plugins
  will trigger a read of the full contents when they are given such an input.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Channels</em>. For multiple channel images, a subset of channels to which to apply the
plugin can be specified by selecting from the list provided.</li>
<li><em>Plugin name</em>. A right click in the field provides a hierarchical popup menu of all
plugins that were loaded (note that deprecated plugin can be loaded from pre-existing
<code>.xml</code> files but are not offered for loading through the GUI). Hovering over a plugin
name in the popup menu displays a tooltip that gives a brief overview of the plugin.</li>
<li><em>Plugin parameters</em>. These parameters are plugin-specific and appear once a plugin has
been selected. For numerical values or ranges, the range of values covered by the
sliders can be manually adjusted (the range is saved along with the selected values to
facilitate adjustment of reloaded tables). Values can be adjusted by typing in a new
number, by using the sliders, or by using the mouse scrollwheel while over the slider.
Any change leads by default to coalesced live updates of the pipeline (this behavior
can be adjusted; see below). Hovering over parameter names displays a tooltip that
offers a brief description of the parameter.</li>
<li><em>Auxiliary inputs</em>. Some plugins require multiple inputs (e.g. a set of active contour
seeds and an image on which to run active contours). The inputs are specified in the
"Auxiliary inputs" column, following the same format as the primary image input column.</li>
<li><em>Auxiliary outputs</em>. For plugins that have multiple outputs, this column provides a
list of names, which Parismi will use to match inputs and outputs of plugins that do
not follow the one input - one output model.</li>
<li><em>Show</em>. GUI views of plugin outputs are created by default for most plugins run in GUI
mode. This behavior can be adjusted on a plugin-by-plugin basis using the "Show"
checkbox. Note that all the outputs of a plugin can be brought to the foreground by
selecting the plugin in the table and clicking the "Bring outputs to front" button.</li>
<li><em>Autorange</em>. When this checkbox is selected, the output image display range
is automatically adjusted to match the minimal and maximal pixel values.</li>
<li><em>On</em>. If this checkbox is not selected, the plugin is skipped when the pipeline is
run.</li>
<li><em>C+</em>. This option will be documented at a later time and can be left to its default
value.</li>
<li>The <em>progress bar</em> shows progression of the plugin as it computes its output. Note
that some plugins provide more fine-grained progress reports than others.</li>
</ul>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p><em>GUI views for Parismi data structures</em></p>

<p>GUI views of plugin outputs include an extended ImageJ image window for image outputs, and
a table view for cells.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Image windows</em> are based on a standard ImageJ display, to which a set of controls and
user interaction functionalities are added. The user can perform <em>de novo</em> cell
annotations, or edits of pre-existing annotations that can be derived from automatic
detection, previous user edits, or any combination thereof. The annotations include cell
position, as well as any combination of user-defined labels, e.g. to denote
manually-determined cell types. The annotations are overlaid with the image; their
graphical display parameters (thickness, diameter, transparency, and color) can be
manually adjusted to provide the most useful display for the particular kind of image
that is used. The position of annotations can be adjusted by dragging. All annotations
in a rectangular region can be deleted in one step by selecting delete mode and dragging
the mouse from one corner of the rectangle to the opposite corner. Hovering over an
annotation for a user-definable delay produces a table listing all information for that
annotation (the table can be preserved by clicking on it; if not it disappears when
moving the mouse away from the annotation). Displayed sections can be "thickened" by
projecting on an interval centered around the slice in view.
The image display can be adjusted in the following ways:

<ul>
<li>The image can be switched back and forth between the "Composite" mode (in which
multiple channels are drawn together, with a different color for each) or the
"Multiple channel" model with the "Make composite" button in the main Parismi window.</li>
<li>Orthogonal views (on which annotations also appear and can be manipulated) can be
toggled on or off with the "Orthogonal" button.</li>
<li>By default the scrollwheel changes the displayed z slice (in the main xy view), or
the displayed x or y slices (in the yz and xy orthogonal views, respectively). For
fine stepping through slices, one can press the x, y, or z keys.</li>
<li>The contrast can be adjusted by using the mouse scrollwheel while pressing shift</li>
<li>One can scroll through the channels by using the mouse scrollwheel while pressing
option</li>
<li>Option-click is a shortcut to add new cells without manually selecting the
corresponding tool. Shift-click is a shortcut to delete.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Cell tables</em>. These tables give a spreadsheet-like presentation of all the fields in
cell objects, which can be the raw cell detections (made by the cell detector and/or by
users), or the detections on which various plugins have been run to add new fields (e.g.
fluorescence contents). Some features are as follows:

<ul>
<li>Interactive histograms are displayed for each column. A range can be selected by
clicking in these histograms, which will cause filtering of the displayed cells.</li>
<li>Cells can be sorted on the value of any field by clicking on the column header.</li>
<li>A scatterplot of two columns can be obtained by selecting cells in any two columns
and clicking "Scatter plot from selected columns". In the resulting graph window, the
x and y axes can be switched an a trendline with user-adjustable local averaging
window can be displayed. If cells were selected from a single column, a histogram
is displayed instead and standard statistics reported.</li>
<li>Basic spreadsheet-like computing functionality is included, which is not fully
implemented and will be documented at a later time.</li>
<li>The results can be exported to a tab-delimited text file (this is for user
convenience, and is of course not required for batch operation).</li>
<li>Note that the segmentation coordinates, which normally comprise a very large set of
numbers, are hidden from the table view. Segmentations can be displayed from cell/seed
objects by running e.g. the <code>DisplaySolidSegmentation</code> plugin, which produces an image
output in which the individual cells can be colored following a user-selected field.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p><em>Running pipelines</em></p>

<ul>
<li>A full run of the pipeline can be initiated by clicking the "Run" button.</li>
<li>A run of the pipeline starting from one particular point can be initiated by selecting
a row in the table and clicking the "Update step" button. If the "Update pipeline upon
param change" checkbox is selected, all plugins following the selected one will also be
run.</li>
<li>Any change to a plugin parameter will by default cause the plugin to recompute its
output (this behavior can be adjusted with the "Update current step upon param change"
checkbox), which will by default in turn cause the next plugins to be also re-run. If a
second parameter change occurs before the re-computing triggered by a first change has
completed, the update for the second change can either be put in a coalescing queue or
cancel the re-computation triggered by the first change.</li>
<li>A pipeline run can be interrupted at any time by clicking the "Stop all updates"
button. Note that plugins differ in how quickly they respond to that button.</li>
</ul>


<p><em>Semi-automated functionality</em></p>

<p>Pipelines often comprise steps for which there is no need for user interaction, and steps
at which it is desirable for a user to review the results and adjust them if need be.
Parismi can be paused at key steps using the <code>Pause</code> plugin; execution can be resumed
after user edits by selecting the appropriate row in the pipeline table and clicking
"Run". To avoid users spending time moving from one dataset to another, one can use the
"Open next and run" button. This button closes all current plugin outputs, and goes
through all input and output file names to increment any numbers that occur between
braces. If datasets are structured in numbered directories, naming files following e.g.
<code>~username/datasets/{1}/input_1.tiff'</code> will make it possible to iterate through all the
directories without manual setup at each dataset change. Note that more sophisticated
batch functionality, which gives more flexibility in terms of file naming and directory
structure, can be achieved using the <code>BatchOpenV2</code> plugin.</p>

<p><em>File formats</em></p>

<p>The file formats that Parismi can read and write are as follows:
  - <em>Images</em>. Parismi can natively read 32-bit-offset Tagged Image File Format (i.e.
  "regular" TIFF) or 64-bit-offset TIFF (i.e. BigTIFF); the latter removes the 2GB or 4GB
  (depending on implementation) limit on file size. Parismi also natively reads the
  proprietary Zeiss LSM file format (which is a TIFF variant). Note that other file types
  can be opened through ImageJ, in particular with the LOCI Bio-Formats plugin, which can
  read a broad array of file types. By default Parismi writes BigTIFF with ImageJ
  metadata to specify channels, although for ease of browsing of output images (since
  BigTIFF is not always supported) it can also rely on ImageJ to output regular TIFF
  images, in which channels can be displayed as an RGB overlay.
  - <em>Cell annotations and segmentations</em>. All data pertaining to automatic cell
  detections, user detections and edits, annotations, segmentations, and quantification
  results are stored in a unified format. Parismi relies on Google's <code>Protobuf</code> file
  format, with fixed fields including cell position and x, y, and z coordinates of all
  pixels in the segmentation mask, as well as optional fields specifying annotations and
  analysis results. Parismi reads and writes corresponding files with the <code>.proto</code>
  extension. To facilitate data exchange with other programs, Protobuf objects can be
  exported to tab-delimited text files (without the segmentation mask) either manually or
  through a plugin. Segmentation masks can also be exported as a single TIFF in which each
  cell receives a pixel value matching its index. Such a file can easily be reused in
  another program such as Matlab.</p>

<p><em>Notes on saved pipelines</em></p>

<p>We normally include in each of our pipelines a plugin to save the pipeline itself in the
dataset directory in which it was run. This allows any interactive user edits that were
made to plugin parameters to be permanently recorded. As plugins evolve, we often find
that we need to add new parameters. To maximize backward compatibility, the programmer can
either transparently specify default values to be given to plugin parameters that did not
exist in earlier pipelines, or specify that an error should be thrown so manual review
must occur.</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p><strong>Batch mode</strong></p>

<p>Batch runs can be performed with <code>java -jar A0PipeLine_Manager.jar batch path_to_pipeline.xml</code>.
This matches the semi-automated functionality described above, except that pauses for
user review are skipped, and no GUI windows are open (for a command-line run without batch
functionality, replace <code>batch</code> by <code>singleRun</code>). When using long pipelines with
adjustments that may need to be made at select steps, it may be a good idea to split
the pipelines in smaller pieces and use <code>make</code> to handle updates. This is what we have
done for the datasets we have released.</p>
